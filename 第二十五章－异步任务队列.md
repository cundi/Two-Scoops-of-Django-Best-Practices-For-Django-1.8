# 第二十五章－异步任务队列
***************************
An asynchronous task queue is one where tasks are executed at a different time from when they are created, and possibly not in the same order they were created. Here is an example of a human-powered asynchronous task queue:  

1. In their spare time, Audrey and Daniel make ice cream cakes, taking orders from friends and family. They use an issue tracker to track their tasks fro scooping, spreading, and decorating each cake.  

2. Every so often, when they have spare time, they review the list of tasks and pick one to do. Audrey prefers scooping and decorating, always doing those tasks first. Daniel prefers scooping and spreading, finishing those before decorating. The result is aynchronous completion of cake-making tasks.

3. As a cake-making task is completed and delivered, they mark the issue as closed.  

>#### TIP: Task Queue vs Asynchoronous Task Queue
>In the Django world, both terms are used to describe asynchronous task queue. When someone writes task queue in the context of Django, they usually mean asynchronous task queue.  

Before we get into best practices, let's go over some definitions:  

**Broker**: The storage for the tasks themselves. This can be implemented using any sort of persistence tool, although in Django the most common ones in use are RabbitMQ an Redis. In the human-powered example. the storage is an online issue tracker.  

## 25.1 Do We Need a Task Queue?
It depends. They add complexity but can really help user experience. Arguably it comes down to whether a paraticulr piece of code causes a bottleneck and can be delayed for later when more free CPU cycles are available.  


Here is a useful rule of thumb for determining if a task queue should be used:  

**Results take time to process**: Task queue should probably be used.  


## 25.2 选择任务队列软件
Celery, Redis Queue, django-background-tasks, 你要选择哪一个呢？让我们来看一看它们之间的共同点和区别：

## 25.3 任务队列的最佳实践

### 25.3.1 如视图那样对待任务
就整本书而言，我们建议视图包含的代码要进可能的小，从代码的其中地方调用方法和函数。我们相信这个方法同样适用于任务。  

### 25.3.2 执行任务是要付出代价的
记住内存和资源

### 25.3.3 对任务函数只传递可序列化的JSON值
就像视图那样，对于任务函数参数而言，我们只能传递可序列化的JSON值。这就限制我们只能使用整数、浮点数、字符串、列表、元组、和字典类型的数据。不要传递复杂的对象。下面是给出的理由：  

1. 

2. 传递到任务队列的复杂对象必须执行序列化，而这样做的事要耗费时间和内存的。

3. 我们发现调试可序列化的JSON值要比调试复杂对象容易很多。  

4. 视所用的任务队列而定，仅可序列化的JSON被原生支持。  

### 25.3.4 是如何监控任务和Worker

### 25.3.5 日志！
因为任务队列是”在幕后“执行工作的，所以很难去搞明白具体发生了什么事情。
